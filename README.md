A computer vision method for Field Emission Microscopy. It counts and compute area of spots created by electron beam projected on scintillator screen. The area is an important metric to characterize emission uniformity on a cathode surface. Although the targeted application is Field Emission Microscopy, the method can be used for any image of spots and background such as counting stars and calculating solid angle on space telescopy.

Watch FEPIC_tutorial.mp4 to learn using the method. The code file is FEPIC_v01.m. To try the code use example images in excercise_images folder.  A paper explaining the method is published here: [https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaelm.1c00789](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaelm.1c00789)
